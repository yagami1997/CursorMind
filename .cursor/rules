# Cursor Engineering Rules
## Project Structure
- Use project_management/control/MAIN_CONTROL.md as the central control document
- Create daily reports in project_management/actuals/reports/daily/daily_report_YYYYMMDD.md
- Generate weekly reports in project_management/actuals/reports/weekly/weekly_report_weekN.md
- Track overall project progress in PROJECT_PROGRESS.md at the root level
- Use templates from project_management/templates/ for creating all new documents

## Code Generation
- Always produce complete, runnable code with proper implementation
- Avoid placeholders or "to be implemented" sections entirely
- Maintain an 80% code to 20% explanation ratio
- Include comprehensive error handling in all code
- Ensure code is optimized and follows best practices

## Anti-Patterns
- If analysis exceeds 20% of time without code production: STOP and use [CODE NOW]
- Prevent feature creep: strictly adhere to defined requirements
- Break circular thinking immediately with the [RESET] command
- Eliminate over-explanation: assume readers have expert knowledge
- Avoid perfectionism that delays delivery of working solutions

## Commands
- [CODE NOW] - Immediately stop analysis and begin writing code
- [FOCUS] - Restrict context to the specified scope to prevent distractions
- [RESET] - Discard current approach and restart with a fresh perspective
- [DECISION] - Finalize a choice and move forward without second-guessing

## Task Format
- Define clear, measurable deliverables and concrete success criteria
- Establish specific time limits for completion of each task
- Set explicit context boundaries to prevent scope expansion
- Provide sequential, actionable steps for implementation
- Include verification methods to confirm successful completion
